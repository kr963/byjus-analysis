# Cracks Beneath the Unicorn: A Data Analysis of Byju's Decline

Once the crown jewel of Indian ed-tech, Byju’s rose with astonishing speed — but its fall was equally dramatic. This project is a data-driven exploration of what went wrong: a blend of hype, hypergrowth, and hard truths hidden in operational and financial signals.

## Why This Project?

This isn’t just an exercise in metrics — it’s a post-mortem with purpose.

As a data analyst, I was intrigued by how a company flush with capital and market dominance could start unraveling. So I approached it not with hindsight bias, but with a forensic lens: If I were on Byju’s analytics team two years ago, what patterns could we have spotted sooner?

## Tech Stack

- **Python** (for data wrangling & storytelling)
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** (for clear, minimal visuals)
- **Tableau / Streamlit** (for interactive dashboarding)
- **Snowflake** (simulated warehouse structure for growth metrics)

## What I Analyzed

- **User Engagement Deterioration** – Drop in monthly active users after key acquisitions
- **Burn Rate Trends** – Sharp rise in CAC and marketing spend vs retention rates
- **Funding vs Fundamentals** – Timeline mismatches between capital raises and ROI
- **Revenue Quality** – Heavy reliance on deferred revenue from prepaid subscriptions

## Key Findings

- Engagement plateaued even as user acquisition budgets exploded.
- Funding rounds often followed downturns — not growth, indicating reactionary capital injections.
- High refund rates began aligning with aggressive sales tactics.
- Operational complexity (multi-product strategy) diluted user value.
